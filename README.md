If you wish to run it locally, or run tests then do the following:
1. Clone this repo (from main)
2. Navigate the root directory of this app
3. Install dependencies: **npm install**
4. To build use: **npm run dev** (if you are on windows the link it opens wont work but if you navigate to localhost:8080 it will work)
5. To run tests or coverage: **npm run test** or **npm run coverage**

## What you can play around with:
- Enter your username
- Open up any repos you want to visit
- Try all our links
- Enter a username that does not exist
- Edit the repo URL by putting in a random ID of your choice to see if it exists
